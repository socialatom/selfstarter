              <summary class=''>How do I setup Stripe for payments?</summary>
              <p>You'll need to <a href="https://manage.stripe.com/signup">create an account</a> with <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>. Afterwards, get your API keys (a total of four: a publishable/secret pair for live-mode, and a publishable/secret pair for test-mode) from the "Settings" tab on your Stripe <a href="https://manage.stripe.com/#account">account</a>. <a href="https://stripe.com/docs">Click here for more info</a>.
                <br />
                <br />
                Once you have your API key, head over to <code>config/settings.yml</code>. Change the <code>stripe_*_key</code>s appropriately.</p>

              <summary>Can I use another payments provider?</summary>
              <p>Of course. This implementation uses <a href="https://stripe.com">Stripe</a>, but the <a href="https://github.com/lockitron/selfstarter">original</a> supports Amazon Payments.</p>

              <p>The faq is a partial located in <code>app/views/preorder/homepage/_faq.html.erb</code> The <code>summary</code> tag is the title, the <code>p</code> is the body. Make sure to add an <code>li</code> tag for each FAQ entry.</p>

              <summary>How do I change around the images, product name, etc?</summary>
              <p>The best way is in <code>config/settings.yml</code>. It has variables for several different parts, the YouTube video, the product name, the call to action button ("Fork Now"), and several more.

              <summary>How do I change the CSS?</summary>
              <p>Head over to <code>app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss</code>. It makes it easy to change around the elements used throughout the HTML.
              <br />
              <br />
              Alternatively, you can dive right into the CSS, have a look at <code>app/assets/stylesheets/main.css.scss</code>.</p>

              <summary>Why did you release this?</summary>
              <p>Hardware startups are less welcome on Kickstarter than they were 6 months ago. We needed to roll our own kickstarter, so we did. Other hardware startups probably will too, so we made it easier for them by open sourcing our way of doing it.</p>

              <summary class=''>What software stack does this use?</summary>
              <p>It's a Ruby on Rails app that makes heavy use of SCSS, Kickstarter's wonderful <code>amazon_flex_pay</code> gem, and a hint of CoffeeScript.</p>

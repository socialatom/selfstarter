# Hi there!
# These are the settings for Selfstarter.
# This is more tidy than changing the HTML if all you want to do is rename things and swap out images

# You should totally change the HTML and CSS though
# Checkout app/assets/stylesheets/variables.css.scss to change around the CSS quickly

# Set your project goal here - dollar amount
# NOTE: if you manually want to adjust your progress to test the site, head over to the Order model (app/models/order.rb)

# If you want to edit the FAQ, head over to app/views/preorder/homepage/_faqs.html.erb

# This will be used in sentences like Hooray Youve just reserved product_description

# video.  When the user clicks it, the vid will replace the image and start playing.
#
# NOTE: you can set this to false, and no image will be use - first frame of the video will be displayed
#
# NOTE: this only works for youtube video at the moment.  If its not for youtube, then just leave this property blank

# Alternatively, change it up in app/assets/stylesheets/homepage/key_points.css.scss
